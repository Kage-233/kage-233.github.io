I am an undergraduate student in [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), 
majoring in **Statistics and Data Science**.

I am passionate about Machine Learning and Deep Learning, statistical analysis in medical diagnostics, and AI agent development.

My research focuses on applying machine learning principles to extract key features and patterns from medical data, aiming to support more accurate and interpretable diagnostics. In parallel, I am also exploring the development of AI agent capable of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to independently complete complex tasks.

## Education

- BSc in Statistics and Data Science, Fudan University, 2027 (Expected)


## News

- I am currently researching AIMGD (AI Agent) with the goal of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to optimize patient-provider communication, supervised by [Wenwen Li](https://www.fdsm.fudan.edu.cn/en/teacher-info.html?UID=012132).

## Some Projects & Github Repositories

My Github Account is [isKage](https://github.com/isKage/), and I am sharing some projects on it.

- Using **Logistic Regression** with **LASSO** regularization, I developed a *Binary Classification Model based on Chest CT Images*. The model achieved an AUC of up to 98.30% on the test dataset. More details are available in [my repository](https://github.com/isKage/r-course-pj).

- Applying **LSTM**, I developed a *Stock prediction model based on neural network LSTM*, more information at [my repository](https://github.com/isKage/rnn-quant). (*Notice: This repository is no longer actively maintained*)

- Applying **ResNet18** pre-trained model, I established a classification for **CIFAR-10**, with accuracy rate [0.76750] in [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cifar-10/). More information at [my repository](https://github.com/isKage/cifar10-classification).

- Developed a Data-Driven Business Decision Platform using Python and Django, focusing on applying fundamental data structures and algorithms to optimize system performance. More details at [my repository](https://github.com/isKage/bidms-dsa-pj).

- Based on **Django + MySQL** framework, I developed a web prototype - *Shared Learning Exchange Platform*, more information at [my repository](https://github.com/isKage/mis).


## Other Experiences

- Participate in The Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) & The Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling [MCM/ICM](https://www.comap.com/contests/mcm-icm). *Sep. 2024 – Oct. 2024*

- Participate in Contemporary Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling [CUMCM](https://en.mcm.edu.cn/index_en.html). *Jan. 2025 – Feb. 2025*
