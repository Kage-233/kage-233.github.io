I am an undergraduate student in [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), 
majoring in **Statistics and Data Science** (2027 Expected).

I am passionate about intersection of Statistics and Machine Learning & Deep Learning, as well as AI Agent Development.

My research focuses on applying machine learning principles to enhance the performance of artificial intelligence systems. In parallel, I am also exploring the development of AI agent capable of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to autonomously accomplish complex tasks.

## Education

- B.S. in Statistics and Data Science, Fudan University, 2027 (Expected)


## News

- **RA** (supervised by [Wenwen Li](https://www.fdsm.fudan.edu.cn/en/teacher-info.html?UID=012132)): I have developed an **AI Agent** (AI Medical General Doctor, AIMGD), whose target is to leverage Large Language Models (**LLMs**) to optimize patient-provider communication. The project has undergone preliminary trials in several community hospitals. More information is available on the website: [link](https://aimgd.online/).

## Some Projects & Github Repositories

My Github Account is [isKage](https://github.com/isKage/), and I am sharing some projects on it.

- Using **Logistic Regression** with **LASSO** regularization, I developed a *Binary Classification Model based on Chest CT Images*. The model achieved an accuracy rate of up to 98.30% on the test dataset (demonstrating comparable performance to CNN while using much fewer parameters). More details are available in [my repository](https://github.com/isKage/r-course-pj).

- Applying **ResNet18** pre-trained model, I established a classification for **CIFAR-10**, with accuracy rate `[0.76750]` in [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cifar-10/). More information at [my repository](https://github.com/isKage/cifar10-classification).

- Applying **LSTM**, I developed a *Stock prediction model based on neural network LSTM*, more information at [my repository](https://github.com/isKage/rnn-quant). (*Notice: This repository is no longer actively maintained*)

- Developed a Data-Driven Business Decision Platform using Python and Django, focusing on applying fundamental data structures and algorithms to optimize system performance. More details at [my repository](https://github.com/isKage/bidms-dsa-pj).

- Based on **Django + MySQL** framework, I developed a web prototype - *Shared Learning Exchange Platform*, more information at [my repository](https://github.com/isKage/mis).
